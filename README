Weblog:

QXGEdit is free, open-source software, distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) [3] version 2 or later.


Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt framework, C++ class library and tools for
        cross-platform application and UI development
        https://qt.io/

  [2] ALSA, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        https://www.alsa-project.org/


Installation
------------

Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] -B build
    cmake --build build [--parallel <Njobs>]

and optionally, as root:

    sudo cmake --install build

See also the README.cmake file in the source distribution.


Configuration
-------------

QXGEdit holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QXGEdit.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qxgedit is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still although this may be considered beta software already. ;)

-------

QXGEdit is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qxgedit).
